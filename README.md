> Spherical data is found in many applications.
> By modeling the discretized sphere as a graph, we can accommodate non-uniformly distributed, partial, and changing samplings.
> Moreover, graph convolutions are computationally more efficient than spherical convolutions.
> As equivariance is desired to exploit rotational symmetries, we discuss how to approach rotation equivariance using the graph neural network introduced in Defferrard et al. (2016).
> Experiments show good performance on rotation-invariant learning problems.
> Code and examples are available at https://github.com/deepsphere.
